        <p class="intro">
            <span class="sentence">Hi, my name is Derek Livermont and this is my website!</span> I'm currently a Software Development student at Bellevue. 
            I've been learning about HTML and CSS and this page is our first attempt to combine the two. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in rural Montana but have moved around a lot in my life. <span class="sentence">My first college experience was in Philadelphia and 
            when I dropped out, I moved to Europe for a bit of time.</span> After coming back to the US, I finally settled down in South Dakota where I live now.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies include cooking, biking, and a fair amount of television. <span class="sentence">Just before the first Covid lockdowns, I made the choice to go vegan and 
            really enjoy trying new and interesting recipes.</span> Sioux Falls also has a great trail system so it's great to get out when temperatures are not freezing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I work as a network engineer but am working on getting a bachelor's in Software Development 
            as well as a CCNP. <span class="sentence">I'm hoping to find more flexibility to travel and see the world like when I was younger.</span> Thanks 
            for visiting my site!
